# Tau-Lepton-Decay-Detection-
This project is about using machine learning techniques to detect a certain type of decay that occurs from a Tau lepton reaction. The data is obtained from CERN 

Two different learning techniques were used in this project. An extreme gradient boost model as well and a deep learning model was developed to be trained on the given data set. 

The performance scores of the respective models are found in the evaluation.py folder.
